# VBA-challenge
Use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

# Instructions:
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
- The ticker symbol
-  Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
-  The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

 Add functionality to your script to return the stock with:
-  "Greatest % increase"
-  "Greatest % decrease"
-  "Greatest total volume"
     
Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
